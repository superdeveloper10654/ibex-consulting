                  Subscriptions
                </h4>
                <h6>
                  License
                </h6>
                <p>Ibex grants you a fully revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the hosted online application and/or download, install and use the application strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
                <h6>
                  Billing
                </h6>
                <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending
                  on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
                <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Ibex cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management
                  page or by contacting the Ibex customer support team.</p>
                <p>A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Ibex with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, post/zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment
                  method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Ibex to charge all Subscription prices incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
                <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Ibex will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated
                  on the invoice.</p>
                <h6>
                  Pricing
                </h6>
                <p>Ibex, at its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the prices for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription price change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
                <p>Ibex will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription prices to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
                <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription price change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription price amount.</p>
                <h6>
                  Refunds
                </h6>
                <p>Requests for Subscription refunds may be considered on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of Ibex. There is no automatic right or expectation of a granted refund request.</p>
                <h6>
                  Free trial
                </h6>
                <p>Ibex may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time. This may also be in the form of a free account that has no time limitation. (“Free Service”)</p>
                <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to subscribe to the Free Service.</p>
                <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Service, you will not be charged by Ibex until the Free Service has expired. On the last day of the Free Service period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you
                  will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription prices for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
                <p>At any time and without notice, Ibex reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Service offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Service offer.</p>
